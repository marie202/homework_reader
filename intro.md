# Machine Learning Course Projects

Welcome to Machine Learning Course projects, a comprehensive reader designed to guide you through the some example term projects from past semesters.  All projects were about machine learning in the context of land use change. This reader is part of our department of  "Artificial Intelligence and Land Use Change" at thr TU Berlin, where we explore the power of artificial intelligence in understanding climate change dynamics in application to  land use. 

Check out [our TU page](https://www.tu.berlin/ai-climate-land-use/studium-lehre/aktuelle-lehrveranstaltungen-sose-24) for more information about our courses.
